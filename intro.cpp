/*
STL: Standard Template Library provides libraries for implementation of basic data structures and algorithms

STL in cpp can be divided into two parts:
- Containers
- Algorithms

Containers can be divided into three parts:
- Simple = PAIRS, vector, forward_list, etc
- Container Adapters: Stack, queues, priority_queues
- Associative : Set, Map, Unordered_set, unordered_map
